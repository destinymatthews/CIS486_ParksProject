# CIS486_ParksProject


In this capstone course, teams were allowed to choose which project they wanted to do. Our team decided to choose the Colbert County Commission Office. The clients wanted websites for their two parks: Alloys Park and Rose Trail Park. In this repository, you will find folders containing the files for each website (Alloys Park and Rose Trail Park) and project documentation.


TECHNICAL FIXES NEEDED IN THE FUTURE:

There were additional small projects tied to this project that are incomplete. They are as follows:
* Brochures: Tiana Hollingsworth captured and edited the pictures for the brochure. She emailed the pictures to the person who requested   the brochures but they never replied to her emails and calls.

* Maps on websites: The clients had contacted Patrick Shremshock at the University of North Alabama to complete the maps that would be embedded in the websites. None of us could ever get in contact with Mr. Shremshock. Instead of leaving the placeholder blank on the website, we put Google Maps in the placeholders on both websites.


INSTRUCTIONS ON DOWNLOADING SOURCE CODE:

* It is highly suggested to download this code as a zip file!
** XAMPP is not needed to run this code.

Testing setup (for both websites):
   1. Download CIS486_ParksProject.zip and extract file
   2. Open up folders and navigate to the pages folder (Alloys Park and Rose Trail Park)
   3. Right click on alloypark.html (Alloys Park) and rosetrialhome.html (Rose Trail) and select 'Open With...' option
   4. Choose desired web browser from 'Open With...' option
   5. The chosen web browser will open the home page. All linked pages and pictures will work.
   NOTE: The linked pages and pictures will not work if the files mentioned in step 3 are removed from their respective folders.
   
   

PROJECT CLOSE AND CLIENT HANDOFF

The project was officially closed December 6, 2018. The clients were happy with their websites. The signed client handoff form can be found in the documentation folder. The clients purchased two new domains at the beginning of the project so that the parks would have their own websties.

Current Domains:
www.colbertcounty.org/parks/alloyspark/ (Alloys Park)
www.colbertcounty.org/parks/rosetrailpark/ (Rose Trail Park)

New Domains:
www.alloyspark.org
www.rosetrailpark.org

To ensure that the clients had no trouble implementing the websites on their new domain, a test run was conducted. Since the new domains are not completely set up, the websites were uploaded to their current domain. We did not want to disrupt their current websites, so we did not make our home page the index page. 

Our websites can be found at the following domains: 
colbertcounty.org/parks/alloyspark/pages/alloypark.html (Alloys Park)
http://colbertcounty.org/parks/rosetrailpark/pages/rosetrialhome.html (Rose Trail Park)
